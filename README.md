ROS driver for Kangaroo X2 motor driver board

Takes a clean copy of the Kangaroo Arduino library provided by Dimension Engineering, and provides a reimplementation of Arduino.h in order to connect to the X2 through a linux serial port instead of Arduino serial. 

The intention is to use this to control the X2 from a Raspberry Pi through an FTDI USB-serial driver.

-updated urdf file
-updated command directions
-added params for serial port connection and baud rate to launch file
-added joints and channels for rear axle



## Test the connection to the motor driver:
```
rosrun kangaroo_x2_driver SpeedControlExample
```
(this will run motor 1 back and forward)

## Create separate controllers for motors 1 and 2:
```
roslaunch kangaroo_x2_driver independent_speed_control.launch
```
The controllers listen for speed commands of type std_msgs/Float64 on topics: 
```
/motor_1_controller/command
/motor_2_controller/command
```

## Differential drive control:
```
roslaunch kangaroo_x2_driver diff_drive_control.launch
```
The differential-drive controller will listen for twist velocity commands published to topic `/diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel`.


## Kangaroo Setup
Ensure the kangaroo board is configured for independent mode (dip-switch 4 is ON) and digital input (dip-switch 1 is ON). Also ensure the board has been tuned with these settings.
